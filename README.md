## Getting Started
First, add a .env file with the following information: 
```
BASE_API_ROUTE=http://localhost:8080
```
*This will be secret in testing and production environments*


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Now that the app is running you can Create, Update and Delete tasks!
